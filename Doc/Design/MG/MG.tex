\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules laid out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is used in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAlgorithm}:] The algorithm 
used to solve the given IVP.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acImplementation}:] The 
implementation of the algorithms used to solve the IVP.
\item ...
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucOutput}:] Output format 
(generated code).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The way the driver 
invokes the software.
\item ...
\end{description}

%\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}
%
%This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
%in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
%below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
%actually be implemented.

\section{Binding Times}

This section will demonstrate the difference between binding times via the 
oft-used power example.

\begin{lstlisting}
let square x = x * x
let rec power n x =
  if n = 0 then 1
  else if n mod 2 = 0 then square (power (n/2) x)
  else x * (power (n-1) x)
(* val power : int -> int -> int = <fun> *)
\end{lstlisting}

(The comment below the code shows the reply of the MetaOCaml toplevel.)

Suppose our program has to compute $x^7$ many times. We may define
\begin{lstlisting}
let power7 x = power 7 x
\end{lstlisting}
to name and share the partial application.

In MetaOCaml, we may also specialize the power function to a particular value 
n, obtaining the code which will later receive x and compute $x^n$. We re-write 
power n x annotating expressions as computed `now' (when n is known) or `later' 
(when x is given).
\begin{lstlisting}
let rec spower n x =
  if n = 0 then .<1>.
  else if n mod 2 = 0 then .<square .~(spower (n/2) x)>.
  else .<.~x * .~(spower (n-1) x)>.;;
(* val spower : int -> int code -> int code = <fun> *)
\end{lstlisting}
The two annotations, or staging constructs, are brackets \lstinline|.< e >.| 
and escape \lstinline|.~e| 
. Brackets \lstinline|.< e >.| `quasi-quote' the expression e, annotating it as 
computed 
later. Escape \lstinline|.~e|, which must be used within brackets, tells that e 
is computed 
now but produces the result for later. That result, the code, is spliced-in 
into the containing bracket. The inferred type of spower is different. The 
result is no longer an int, but int code -- the code of expressions that 
compute an int. The type of spower spells out which argument is received now, 
and which later: the future-stage argument has the code type. To specialize 
spower to 7, we define
\begin{lstlisting}
let spower7_code = .<fun x -> .~(spower 7 .<x>.)>.;;
(*
val spower7_code : (int -> int) code = .<
  fun x_1 ->
    (x_1 *
      (((* cross-stage persistent value (id: square) *))
        (x_1 * (((* cross-stage persistent value (id: square) *)) (x_1 * 1)))))
  >.
*)
\end{lstlisting}
and obtain the code of a function that will receive x and return $x^7$. Code, 
even of functions, can be printed, which is what MetaOCaml toplevel just did. 
The print-out contains so-called cross-stage persistent values, or CSP, which 
`quote' present-stage values such as square to be used later. One may think of 
CSP as references to `external libraries' -- only in our case the program acts 
as a library for the code it generates. If square were defined in a separate 
file, say, sq.ml, then its occurrence in \lstinline|spower7_code| would have 
been printed 
simply as Sq.square.

To use thus specialized $x^7$ now, in our code, we should `run' 
\lstinline|spower7_code|, 
applying the function \lstinline|Runcode.run : 'a code -> 'a|. The function 
compiles the 
code and links it back to our program. 
%For historical reasons, Runcode.run is aliased to the prefix operation (!.):

\begin{lstlisting}
open Runcode
let spower7 = !. spower7_code
(* val spower7 : int -> int = <fun> *)
\end{lstlisting}

The specialized \lstinline|spower7| has the same type as the partially applied 
\lstinline|power7| above. They behave identically. However, 
\lstinline|power7 x| will do the recursion on $n$, checking $n$'s parity, etc. 
In contrast, the specialized \lstinline|spower7| has no recursion (as can be 
seen from \lstinline|spower7_code|). All operations on n have been done when 
the \lstinline|spower7_code| was computed, producing the straight-line code 
\lstinline|spower7| that only multiplies $x$.

MetaOCaml supports an arbitrary number of later stages, letting us write not 
only code generators but also generators of code generators, etc.

\subsection{Compile-Time}
The generator and its RK methods will be completely defined at this time.

\subsection{Generation Time}
The ODE, range, step size, and algorithm are known at generation time. Since 
these will not change, the IVP can be solved at this time.

\subsection{Run-Time}
The function that will return values for any input within the specified 
interval will execute at run-time.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

N/A. While the commonality analysis has clear implications, the requirements 
are not explicitly recorded anywhere. 

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  Also indicate if the
module will be implemented specifically for the software.

Only the leaf modules in the
hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means
that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or
not this module is implemented depends on the programming language
selected.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{mHH})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The data structure and algorithm used to implement the virtual
  hardware.
\item[Services:]Serves as a virtual hardware used by the rest of the
  system. This module provides the interface between the hardware and the
  software. So, the system can use it to display outputs or to accept inputs.
\item[Implemented By:] OS
\end{description}

\subsection{Behaviour-Hiding Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The contents of the required behaviours.
\item[Services:]Includes programs that provide externally visible behaviour of
  the system as specified in the software requirements specification (SRS)
  documents. This module serves as a communication layer between the
  hardware-hiding module and the software decision module. The programs in this
  module will need to change if there are changes in the SRS.
\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Input Format Module (\mref{mInput})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The format and structure of the input data.
\item[Services:]Converts the input data into the data structure used by the
  input parameters module.
\item[Implemented By:] [Your Program Name Here]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}


\subsection{Software Decision Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The design decision based on mathematical theorems, physical
  facts, or programming considerations. The secrets of this module are
  \emph{not} described in the SRS.
\item[Services:] Includes data structure and algorithms used in the system that
  do not provide direct interaction with the user. 
  % Changes in these modules are more likely to be motivated by a desire to
  % improve performance than by externally imposed changes.
\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.
